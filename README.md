# curl URL Tester

Shell script that checks if a URL exists and reports the HTTP status code and the corresponding request to a file.

I found this useful when needing to test redirects during sitemap audits to ensure nothing 404's. You might find it useful for something else! Who knows.

### TODO

* Validate URL list file (check for http(s):// syntax)
* Progress bar (useful for large batches of URLs)
